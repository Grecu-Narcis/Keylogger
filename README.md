## Project Overview

Welcome to the C++ Keylogger project. This keylogger is designed to capture pressed keys on Windows systems, while incorporating a range of advanced functionalities. The project is a continuous effort, with regular updates to enhance its capabilities and utility.

## Features

- **Stealth Mode:** Hide the keylogger console to operate covertly without user detection.
- **Start Logging:** Capture and log each pressed key to a designated file for record-keeping.
- **Register Persistence:** Ensure the keylogger runs automatically at system boot for consistent operation.
- **Encrypt Messages:** Implement message encryption to enhance the security of logged data.
- **Send Email Notifications:** Send encrypted email notifications containing logged data to a specified email address.
